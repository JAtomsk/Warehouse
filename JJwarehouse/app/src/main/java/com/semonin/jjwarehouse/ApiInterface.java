/**
 * ApiInterface Class
 *
 * Purpose:
 * This interface defines the API endpoints for the application using Retrofit annotations to encode details about the network
 * requests. It specifies the methods for registering and logging in users, corresponding to the server-side routes that handle
 * these operations. Retrofit uses this interface to generate the necessary code for making HTTP requests.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Registration Endpoint: Allows new users to register by sending their username and password to the server.
 * - Login Endpoint: Allows users to log in by validating their credentials against those stored in the server's database.
 *
 * Usage:
 * This interface is utilized by creating an instance of Retrofit and calling these methods with required parameters.
 * The Retrofit client automatically handles the request execution and response parsing based on the definitions provided here.
 *
 * Example:
 * ApiInterface api = RetrofitClient.getRetrofitInstance().create(ApiInterface.class);
 * Call<UserResponse> call = api.registerUser(new User("username", "password"));
 * call.enqueue(new Callback<UserResponse>() {...});
 *
 * This setup enables clear separation of network operations from the rest of the application's code, making it easier to manage.
