/**
 * SecurityUtils Class
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Initially used for providing cryptographic utilities within the application, specifically for hashing passwords with SHA-256.
 * This class was crucial for ensuring password security when the application utilized an SQLite database, helping to safeguard
 * user data by preventing passwords from being stored in plaintext.
 *
 * Features:
 * - SHA-256 Hashing: Implements SHA-256 to securely hash passwords, providing a non-reversible, fixed-size hash.
 *   This method is essential for protecting passwords against various security threats, including brute force attacks.
 *
 * Evolution of Security Measures:
 * Although effective during the initial stages of the application, the SecurityUtils class was phased out as the application
 * transitioned to a more secure and robust user authentication system using MySQL and bcrypt. Bcrypt enhances security by
 * being computationally intensive and automatically incorporating salt to defend against rainbow table attacks.
 * This shift was part of a broader enhancement to address growing security needs and implement industry-standard practices.
 *
 * Usage:
 * The class was utilized in earlier versions of the application where security practices necessitated an in-house solution
 * for password management. It is included in the current codebase as a historical reference to demonstrate the applicationâ€™s
 * commitment to evolving security practices and adapting to enhanced security measures.
