    <section id="databases">
        <h2>Databases</h2>
        <p>Database Enhancement:</p>
        <p>Before transitioning to a MySQL database, the JJWarehouse application used SQLite for local data management through the DatabaseHelper.java class. This class facilitated creating and managing the application's database, including user and inventory data. SQLite, embedded within Android applications, allowed for straightforward and efficient data operations directly on the device.</p>
    
        <p>The old DatabaseHelper class provided a full suite of CRUD operations. It managed user authentication by storing usernames and hashed passwords, ensuring basic security. The inventory management was handled through similar CRUD operations, allowing the application to add, retrieve, update, and delete inventory items as needed. Each inventory item was identified by a unique ID, with additional attributes like name and quantity stored in a structured format.</p>
    
        <p>For user authentication, the class included methods to add new users with hashed passwords and to verify login credentials by comparing hashed passwords stored in the database. This approach, while effective for smaller, standalone applications, lacked the robust security and scalability provided by server-based databases like MySQL, prompting the transition. The move to MySQL, coupled with bcrypt for hashing and JWT for session management, marked a significant enhancement in the application’s security and data management capabilities, aligning it more closely with industry standards and practices.</p>
    
        <p>Database Enhancement List:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Migrated away from SQLite database to AWS MySql Database</li>
            <li>Added modern frameworks (Node.js, Express, CORS)</li>
            <li>Implemented bcrypt for password hashing.</li>
            <li>Implemented JSON Web Token for Secure Authentication</li>
            <li>Redesigned Database Schema with introduction of Tables (Items, Users,) with columns for IDs, name and quantities.</li>
            <li>Began work on Role-Based Access Control.</li>
            <li>Designed and implemented RESTful API Development server to manage all backend operations for the JJWarehouse inventory management application.</li>
            <li>Improved Error Handling and Validation.</li>
            <li>Search Functionality adapted to new database.</li>
            <li>UI/UX refinement to support new features.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <p>Classes and Methods Added for Enhancement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ApiInterface:</strong> This interface was added to define all the server communication endpoints for the Retrofit HTTP client. It includes methods for user registration, login, adding, updating, and deleting inventory items, among others. This class plays a crucial role in defining how the app interacts with the backend API.</li>
            <li><strong>LoginResponse and UserResponse:</strong> These classes were developed to handle responses from the server during login and user registration processes. They encapsulate the success status, messages, and other relevant data like tokens or user IDs returned by the server.</li>
            <li><strong>ItemResponse and ItemsResponse:</strong> Similar to LoginResponse, these classes are designed to handle responses related to inventory items from the server. ItemResponse deals with responses for single item operations, while ItemsResponse manages responses for requests that involve multiple items, such as fetching the entire inventory.</li>
            <li><strong>RetrofitClient:</strong> This class creates and configures the Retrofit instance used throughout the app to make network requests. It ensures that there is a single, reusable instance of Retrofit that includes all necessary configurations, such as the base URL and Gson converter for JSON parsing.</li>
            <li><strong>SharedPreferenceManager:</strong> Introduced to manage shared preferences, specifically for storing and retrieving JWT tokens and user roles locally on the device. This class is crucial for session management and ensuring that user credentials are handled securely.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The skills for this artifact demonstrate a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture. By transitioning from a local SQLite database to a robust MySQL database, paired with a secure server-side environment, we have significantly enhanced the security and scalability of our data management practices. This proactive approach helps mitigate potential security threats, with bcrypt for password hashing and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management enhancing the protection against password cracking and token theft. Additionally, HTTPS connections between the mobile app and the server encrypt all transmitted data, safeguarding against unauthorized access during transit.</p>
    
        <p>The application employs advanced algorithmic strategies to optimize performance, utilizing Big O notation considerations to streamline data retrieval processes. Methods like fetchData and filterData in the DataGridFragment are designed for efficient interaction with the MySQL database via REST API calls, ensuring quick and scalable data access. The use of SQL's LIKE query optimized with indices demonstrates an efficient implementation of search functionalities that minimize time complexity and enhance responsiveness.</p>
    
        <p>Furthermore, the integration of these technologies not only addresses the immediate requirements of efficient data access but also aligns with broader industry standards that emphasize security, performance, and maintainability. By handling heavy data processing server-side, we maintain the application's responsiveness and scalability, crucial for mobile environments where resource constraints are significant.</p>
    
        <p>The development of the inventory application has been geared towards creating an inclusive and user-friendly environment. The simple and intuitive design of the user interface makes it accessible for users of all technical levels, promoting broader engagement and supporting organizational goals like efficient inventory management and data accuracy. Real-time data insights provided by the inventory management features enable effective decision-making, crucial for maintaining operational success.</p>
    
        <p>In summary, this project exemplifies a comprehensive approach to software development that integrates user feedback and employs robust data management and security practices. By focusing on collaborative tools that enhance user satisfaction and operational efficiency, the application supports diverse organizational roles and demonstrates a commitment to developing solutions that are not only functional but also secure and adaptable to future technological advancements.</p>
